#themes are declared with leading "@theme:" followed by a space and then the name identifier
#they are closed with an "@end_theme" tag
#the whole theme area is converted into a single string to be interpreted by the
#setStyleSheet function
#remember to setup the ui widgets first so that this is applied correctly
#ex: setup ui, read this doc, spawn widget and tabs to enherit this theme
